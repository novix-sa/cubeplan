# Introduction
Pyplan is the unique platform for developing Business Intelligence, Data Analytics and Corporate Performance Management (CPM) apps based on the *lingua franca* of data science: Python

Apps are developed through a drag and drop user interface that allows creating the calculation logic and the Input/Output user interface in a very user-friendly way.

In general terms, Pyplan is an integrated development environment (IDE) of Python data analytics and data modeling Apps.

## Data Analysis and Modeling
In Pyplan the calculation logic is structured through influence diagrams, a visual representation of the process logic that brings transparency to the app data processes.

The calculation steps are defined using the most popular Python libraries like:

 - Pandas for working with database like information 
 - Xarrays for handling multidimensional labeled arrays 
 - and Numpy for powerful N-dimensional array (unnamed) operations

Pyplan also includes many helpers functions for making easy model creation and object manipulation. These functions are called using the pp. prefix.
Here you can find the complete list and description of Pyplan specific function list. 

Any other existing Python library can also be used in Pyplan as soon as the Administrator of the system authorize its installing on the server.
Any process step (nodes) can be run and its result be represented as a console output (Ctrl E), as a pivot-table or as a graph a.
 tableinspected and evaluated to check its logic, outputs and performance . Double clicking the node, it is evaluated, showing it result as a table or graph for further analysis.

## Input-Output User Interfaces
Any step in the process could be used as an Input/Output module. Nodes and Indexes are the building blocks of user interfaces.
Menus for navigating apps can be easily defined. Apps can be shared between partners or even to the general public through shareable links.
