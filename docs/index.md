# Introduction
In general terms, Pyplan is an integrated development environment (IDE) of Python data analytics and data modeling Apps.
More specifically Pyplan is a platform
Apps are developed through a drag and drop user interface that allows creating the calculation logic and the Input/Output user interface.
## Data Analysis and Modeling
The calculation logic is structured through influence diagrams, a visual representation of the calculation logic that brings transparency to the app data processes.
The calculation logic is created using the most popular Python libraries like:

 - Pandas for working with database like information 
 - Xarrays for handling multidimensional labeled arrays 
 - and Numpy for powerful working with N-dimensional array (unnamed)

Any other Python library can be used (imported) as the Administrator of the system authorize its installing on the server.
The process steps (nodes) can be inspected and evaluated to check its logic, outputs and performance (Ctrl E).
Double clicking the node, it is evaluated, showing it result as a table or graph for further analysis.

## Input-Output User Interfaces
Any step in the process could be used as an Input/Output module. Nodes and Index are the the building blocks of user interfaces.


Apps are later shared between partners or even to the general public.

# File Manager  
In this section, you will learn how to manage different files on which the model is based. You can duplicate folders, create new ones, rename existing files, move a file to a different location, compress and unzip a file, upload new files or download existing ones.

# Editing Models  
In this section, you will learn how to edit the model preferences. You will learn to evaluate nodes, navigate into the diagram, import and export modules. Then you will create nodes with functiones and number format. These nodes can have a style, color, size and alignment. At the end, the Function List.
