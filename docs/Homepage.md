# Pyplan
What it is:

**Pyplan.org**
Pyplan is an integrated development environment (IDE) of Python data analytics and data modeling Apps.
Apps are developed through a drag and drop interface that allows creating the calculation logic and the Input/Output user interface.
## Data Analysis and Modeling
The calculation logic is structured through influence diagrams, a visual representation of the calculation logic that brings transparency to the app data processes.
The calculation logic is created using the most popular Python libraries like:

 - Pandas for working with database like information 
 - Xarrays for handling multidimensional labeled arrays 
 - and Numpy for powerful working with N-dimensional array (unnamed)

Any other Python library can be used (imported) as the Administrator of the system authorize its installing on the server.
The process steps (nodes) can be inspected and evaluated to check its logic, outputs and performance (Ctrl E).
Double clicking the node, it is evaluated, showing it result as a table or graph for further analysis.

## O
Any step in the process could later be used as an Input/Output module, that are the building blocks of user interfaces.
Apps are later shared between partners or even to the general public.
