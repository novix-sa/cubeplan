What it is:

**Pyplan.org**
Pyplan is an integrated development environment (IDE) of Python data analytics and data modeling Apps.
Apps are developed through a drag and drop interface that allows creating the calculation logic and the Input/Output user interface.
The calculation logic is structured through influence diagrams, a visual representation of the calculation logic that brings transparency to the app data processes.
The calculation logic is created using the most popular Python libraries like:
	Pandas for working with datas
Any step in the process could later be used as an Input/Output module, that are the building blocks of user interfaces.
Apps are later shared between partners or even to the general public.
